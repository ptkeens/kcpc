- This project is an SST3 (3.10.0) typescript project using AWS as the backing infrastructure provider. 
- the API layer is graphql, all requests for data and mutations to data need to pass through this layer.
- We are using react-router for the frontend as well.
- Whenever you are supplying code-related suggestions that mention functions from a package, please check the root `package.json` file to see what version is in use, and ensure your suggetsions match up with the specified version. 
- This project uses bun to manage dependencies. 
- I am using Prisma with an aurora serverless postgres database. 
- Authentication should leverage the db, and we should put the current user information into the graphql context.
- The graphql context should have an authenticated and unauthenticated state
- Please do not rush changes. Think through your answers, validate your assumptions. Double check package versions.
- Please do not make changes to the code, suggest them and ask me if I would like you to apply them.
- Create files with camel-case or pascal-case names. Do the same for variables and functions.
