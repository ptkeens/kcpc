This project is an SST3 typescript project using AWS as the backing infrastructure provider. We are using react-router for the frontend as well. Whenever you are supplying code-related suggestions that mention functions from a package, please check the root `package.json` file to see what version is in use, and ensure your suggetsions match up with the specified version. This project uses bun to manage dependencies. I am using Prisma with a postgres serverless database. Authentication should leverage the db and JWT.

Please do not make changes to the code, suggest them and ask me if I would like you to apply them.
Slow down and think about your suggestions before supplying a solution, double check your reasoning and question your assumptions.

Create files with camel-case or pascal-case names. Do the same for variables and functions.
